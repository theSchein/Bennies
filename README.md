# Bennies.fun

This is the main repo for the Bennies.fun web app. The goal of this app was to be a wikipedia for NFTs, development it currently on hold for several reasons. Mainly due to a lack of ability to monetize NFT information.

### The Stack

- Written in Javascript
- Nextjs13 React Framework (pages routing) 
- Postgress Database Interface
- Deployed on Vercel for both app hosting and database
- Alchemy & Moralis 3rd party APIs for pulling NFT data
- Tailwind CSS for Styling

## Status

PROTOTYPE LEVEL
The app has a lot of pieces that work but does not yet come together as a viable product ready to launch

### Things that Work
- Making profiles and commenting on NFTs
- Searching for NFTs (in a limited way)

### Top Priorities
- Redirect to temporary Landing Page
- Performance bug fixes (handliing session and api requests better)
- Collection Pages
- Allow owners/creators to edit pages
- Nested comments rendering

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
vercel dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
